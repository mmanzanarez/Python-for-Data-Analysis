#### A. Basic commands

1. Navigate to your working directory for the class.
2. Within that directory, create a temporary test directory.
3. Create a file using one method I showed you.
4. Create a file using a different method I showed you.

*Copy your terminal commands and output as your answers.*

#### B. Working with commands

1. Pick a command from class. Using a Unix command to find out, what does this command do?
2. Pick a command from class. Using a Google search to find out, what does this command do?
3. Where are the commands `mv` and `cp` are located on your computer?
4. What happens when you type `Tab` in the middle of typing a command?
